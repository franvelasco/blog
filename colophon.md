# This is a work in progress.

### Technology

All code was created on June 2020 using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}.

I wrote most of the code from scratch in Markdown using [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/){:target="_blank"} from scratch by the old trial and error method. 

The files are hosted on [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com){:target="_blank"}.

### Typography

Header texts use a self-hosted version of [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/){:target="_blank"}, created by [Rasmus Anderson](https://rsms.me/about/){:target="_blank"}.

Body text as this one is [Libre Baskerville](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville){:target="_blank"}, created by [Impalliari](http://www.impallari.com/projects/overview/libre-baskerville){:target="_blank"}, served and hosted by [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Libre+Baskerville){:target="_blank"}.

### Photography

All photographs by me, unless another author is named.
